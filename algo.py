    """
    Parameters
    ---------
    X : 2D array or sparse matrix
        The dataset to analyse
    n : int
        The number of pairs you'd like to get
    s : int
        The number of pairs the algo will retrieve at each levels of the dendrogram
    min_size : int
        The minimum size of a cluster in order to consider it as relevant. If len(cluster) < min_size, it is skipped
    metric : str
        The metric to use to compute the distance. See sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances for more information. Common ones are "euclidean", "cityblock" and "cosine".
    start : int
        Where to start in the dendrogram. If start != 0, we'll skip start levels of the dendrogram.
    debug : boolean
        If True, print some debug informations

    -------

    #  How does the algo work (in pratice ?)
    #  The basic idea is that we run through the dendrogram from top to bottom.
    #  At every split of the dendrogram, we have two clusters. If one of the cluster
    #  has less points than min_size, we go to the next split. If there are enough points
    #  in the 2 clusters, we add the indexes of the s-closest pairs to the result.
    #  In order to get the i-th split of the dendrogram, we make an Agglomerative Clustering
    #  with i+1 cluster. and one with i+2 clusters. Then we look at the difference between
    #  them both and deduce which points belongs the new branch of the dendrogram.
    #  We stop either when we reach the end of the dendrogram or when we have taken n pairs of points
